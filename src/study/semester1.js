      { code: "AI001", name: "Elements of AI", description: "This course, developed by the University of Helsinki, introduced me to the fundamentals of artificial intelligence, including its definitions, core concepts (like autonomy and adaptability), and real-world applications such as self-driving cars, recommendation systems, and image recognition. I gained a deeper understanding of how AI systems operate, how they differ from human intelligence, and why common terms like learning or understanding can be misleading in this context. The course also encouraged critical reflection on the societal impact of AI and helped me build a clear conceptual foundation for future work in the field." },
      { code: "AI002", name: "Building AI", description: "In the Building AI course, I deepened my understanding of algorithms and methods behind real-world applications of artificial intelligence. I learned how to use optimization techniques, apply probability-based reasoning such as Bayesâ€™ theorem in classification, and explored key machine learning methods including linear regression, nearest neighbor, and neural networks. I also gained insights into natural language processing, overfitting issues, and the importance of model generalization. Through practical exercises, I developed the ability to design realistic AI solutions and to effectively communicate both their value and limitations." },

      { code: "KPI55", name: "Technology in Education", description: "This course taught me how to meaningfully integrate digital tools into teaching by shifting the focus from delivering content to facilitating learning. I explored frameworks like ADDIE and design thinking, worked with tools such as Loom and Marvel App, and designed learner-centered activities that promote engagement, autonomy, and reflection. The course also deepened my understanding of accessibility, inclusion, and the pedagogical potential and limits of educational technology." }
