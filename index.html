    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello! I'm Marie Anna Mahdalová! This portfolio showcases the subjects I've taken as part of my academic journey.</p>
    <p>I'm currently studying Information Sciences at Masaryk University in Brno, where I'm diving deep into topics I’m passionate about. Before this, I completed my secondary education at Realgymnasium Komensky in Vienna, a bilingual school that helped me refine my academic skills in both English and German. I also had the opportunity to study in the UK for a year at Ysgol Hirael in Bangor, which really broadened my global perspective.</p>
    <p>Throughout my educational journey, I’ve been actively engaged in leadership and volunteering. As a School Representative at Realgymnasium Komensky, I represented my school at an international level, collaborating with peers from diverse backgrounds. I’ve also been a proud member of Amnesty International since 2019, where I’ve worked on organizing campaigns, raising awareness for human rights, and participating in outreach events to create lasting impact.</p>
    <p>Work-wise, I’ve gained hands-on experience in different fields. I worked as an Event Security Specialist with Patronus GmbH, where I coordinated safety processes and managed event logistics. I also spent a summer as a Children’s Summer Camp Leader with LT U SMRKU, organizing fun and safe activities for kids, which was a really rewarding experience. </p>
    <p>Beyond my work and studies, I’ve taken part in several certifications and courses to keep building my skills. I participated in the Youth Parliament of the Czech Republic’s International Experience Exchange, and I’ve also completed a series of Soft Skills courses that taught me about project management, team building, and rhetoric. I’ve also been involved with initiatives like the Women's Engagement in Public Spaces project and the Wikigap workshop, which focused on gender representation online.</p>
    <p>I’m fluent in Czech and English, with a solid level of German. I enjoy collaborating in teams, leading initiatives, and communicating effectively with people from all walks of life. I’m always keen to learn new things and apply my skills in different settings, and I look forward to what’s next on my journey.</p>
